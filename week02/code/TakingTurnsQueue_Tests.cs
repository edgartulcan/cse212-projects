    // 1) Turns for finite players were decremented at the wrong time or not at all,
    //    causing the dequeue/re-enqueue sequence to deviate from the expected
    //    round-robin order: Bob(2), Tim(5), Sue(3) => 
    //    Bob, Tim, Sue, Bob, Tim, Sue, Tim, Sue, Tim, Tim.
    // 2) Queue length tracking was incorrect (exhausted players remained in the queue),
    //    so the loop did not terminate when expected.
    // 3) AddPerson/GetNextPerson ordering did not maintain strict FIFO behavior.

    // Expected Result: Bob, Tim, Sue, Bob, Tim, Sue, Tim, George, Sue, Tim, George, Tim, George

    // 1) Adding a player mid-rotation did not enqueue at the tail, breaking FIFO.

    //    Bob, Tim, Sue, Bob, Tim, Sue, Tim, George, Sue, Tim, George, Tim, George.

    //    their last turn was consumed (turns == 0), corrupting the expected order.
    // 3) The queue Length property was not updated consistently after additions.

    // 1) Negative turns were not treated as infinite; player Tim(-3) must be re-enqueued
